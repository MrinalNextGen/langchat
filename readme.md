# Lang-Chat

Lang-Chat is a web-based chatbot application designed to help users understand the LangChain library and troubleshoot common issues. It leverages a knowledge base built from scraping LangChain's documentation and GitHub issues up to November 22, 2024.

## Project Overview

The Lang-Chat project was initially developed as a personal tool to deepen the understanding of the LangChain library and assist with common problems. During the development process, the team discovered an existing solution called [Chat LangChain](https://chat.langchain.com/), a more comprehensive implementation available freely.

Despite the existence of Chat LangChain, the team decided to continue and complete their own version to contribute to the community and offer an alternative solution. Lang-Chat serves as a proof of concept and is actively being developed, with more features planned to be added over time.

## Key Features

- **Chatbot Interface**: Users can ask questions about LangChain, and the chatbot will provide responses based on the scraped knowledge base.
- **Source Document Exploration**: Users can view the source documents (LangChain documentation and GitHub issues) that the chatbot referenced in its responses.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The knowledge base is updated regularly, ensuring the chatbot can provide the most up-to-date information to users.
